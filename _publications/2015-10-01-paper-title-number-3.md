Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a hallmark Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology linked to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. While tau-PET and blood tau assays support in-vivo detection, PET is costly and blood markers lack regional specificity. MRI is noninvasive and widely available, and it offers measures of not only neurodegeneration, but also cerebrovascular abnormalities, typically inaccessible to PET or blood markers. We developed an MRI-based classifier of Braak NFT staging using machine learning on ex-vivo MRI and neuropathology data from community-based older adults.
