## Overview

Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (AD-NC) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) frequently co-occur in older adults, but their **distinct and overlapping neurodegeneration patterns** remain difficult to disentangle—especially because LATE is currently confirmed only at autopsy. In this talk, I presented a large autopsy-confirmed study combining **ex vivo MRI** with **detailed neuropathology** to map brain atrophy signatures associated with **AD, LATE, and their comorbidity**.

## Methods (high level)

Using ex vivo MRI from community-based older adults who came to autopsy, we applied **deformation-based morphometry (DBM)** and voxel-wise statistical testing to compare atrophy patterns across **AD± / LATE±** groups while controlling for demographics, scanner effects, postmortem intervals, and other common co-pathologies.

## Key findings

- **AD-only** and **LATE-only** groups showed prominent atrophy primarily in **medial temporal lobe** regions.  
- **AD+LATE (comorbid)** cases demonstrated **more extensive and widespread tissue loss** than either pathology alone.  
- Importantly, **advanced LATE (stage 2/3)** was associated with **more severe anterior hippocampal atrophy** than moderate/severe AD, highlighting a differential regional vulnerability.

## Why it matters

These pathology-anchored atrophy patterns help clarify how AD and LATE differ in the brain and motivate the development of imaging biomarkers that can better **separate mixed etiologies**, improve **clinical trial stratification**, and refine interpretation of medial temporal atrophy in aging.
