## Overview
Neurofibrillary tangles are a core Alzheimer’s pathology and are closely linked to brain atrophy and cognitive decline. In this talk, I presented an MRI-based classifier for tangles that leverages **ex vivo MRI + autopsy-confirmed neuropathology** from a large community-based cohort. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Approach (high level)
- **Cohort & imaging:** 878 autopsied older adults from Rush longitudinal cohort studies (MAP/ROS/MARS) with ex vivo 3T MRI and detailed neuropathologic examination. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Model:** L2-regularized **SVM** to classify **Braak V–VI vs. 0–IV**, using demographics (age, sex) plus multimodal MRI-derived features (volumetry, cortical thickness, subcortical shape, diffusion, R2). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Evaluation subset:** performance reported on the subset with all feature groups available (N=74). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

## Key result
The combined model achieved **AUC = 0.87** with **82% sensitivity** and **77% specificity**, outperforming a published in vivo MRI+pathology approach reported at **AUC = 0.69** (different label definition). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why it matters
Successful ex vivo → in vivo translation of this work could enable a **non-invasive tangles classifier** to support refined participant selection and targeted therapies. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
