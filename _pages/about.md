I’m a PhD candidate in **Biomedical Engineering (Medical Imaging)** at **Illinois Institute of Technology**. I work with **Prof. Konstantinos Arfanakis** and the **Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center** to study age-related neuropathologies.

My research focuses on **autopsy-validated MRI, PET, and blood-based biomarkers** to characterize:
- Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (**ADNC**)
- Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (**LATE-NC**)
- **Cerebral small vessel diseases** like Arteriolosclerosis, Atherosclerosis and Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)

## What I do

Broadly, I develop **machine learning models** and **method pipelines** that link **in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI** with **neuropathology** and **cognition**, with the goal of building deployable biomarkers that generalize across **scanners, sites, and cohorts**.

This includes work on:
- MRI‑based markers of **neurofibrillary tangles**, translating autopsy‑grounded signatures into tools that can be used in living cohorts. 
- Quantifying brain structure and atrophy patterns to separate and combine the effects of **Alzheimer’s disease**, **LATE**, and **cerebrovascular diseases**.
- Tracking **vascular** and **neurodegenerative diseases** over time, integrating **imaging** and **blood biomarkers** to understand progression and its impact on **cognition**.

## I’m excited about environments where these tools can be used to

- Clean up heterogeneity in **Alzheimer’s and mixed-pathology trials**
- Design efficient **MRI- and blood-based screening and staging** strategies
- Translate pathology-grounded imaging markers into robust, **containerized software** that collaborators can run on their own infrastructure

## Connect

I’m open to postdoc and research scientist roles in neuroimaging, biomarkers, and clinical ML. If you’re working on multimodal aging/AD cohorts, I’d love to connect.
